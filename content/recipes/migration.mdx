# Migration guide

First and foremost. If you are happy with current Provider/inject pattern, there is nothing you need to change in your application. This guide is intented as the path to the future of React and tools that might provide you with better comfort.

> Gradual migration is absolutely possible. Don't rewrite your whole app at once.

Since the introduction of [React Context](/recipes-context), the inject pattern [is considered obsolete](/recipes-inject) and it's highly recommended to migrate away over the time. Don't worry, it won't disappear from the library anytime soon.

## **Prerequisite**: Upgrade to mobx-react 6.x

The library has been internally rewritten to use new Context. You will need React 16.8 to upgrade to this version.

### What about mobx-react 5.x?

If you are forced to stick to the older version (most likely because older React), there isn't really anything you can do right now and just keep using inject as you are used to.

## Hooks for the rescue

React Hooks are most likely the easiest way to consume MobX store. They give you a freedom in how to do things instead of heavily opinionated inject. Consider following example.

```tsx
import { observer } from 'mobx-react'
const UserOrderInfo = observer(() => {
  const { user, order } = useStores()
  return (
    <div>
      {user.name} has order {order.id}
    </div>
  )
})
```

But...but...**mixing state with a component UI is bad practice**, right? Well, nobody is forcing you to do that. If accessing context in UI component bothers you, just pass it through the props from a parent component. Or make your own HOC or render prop component if you must.

Ok, that's cool, but let's take a step back here. How to exactly move from inject to such solution you might ask? It's very easy.

The `mobx-react@6` exposes a Context object as `MobXProviderContext` for the purposes of gradual migration. You can make a simple hook like that.

```tsx
import { MobXProviderContext } from 'mobx-react'
function useStores() {
  return React.useContext(MobXProviderContext)
}
```

That's all the basics you need to understand. You can simply use such hook for any function components you have refactored to hooks.

You can build on top of that and make a solution that fits your needs. For example have a hook for each separate store, eg. `useUserStore` or `useOrderStore`. It's a similar to passing string to inject, but much safer.

### Why the hook is not exported from package?

It's becoming a good practice for packages to always hide the Context object and only export a relevant hook. Usually the reason are to abstract some internals tucked away in context. However, in case of MobX, there is nothing to hide, it's stores you have added there.

Think of it more like tool for migration. The concept of Context is so simple that there is no added value of having it inside the library. If you ever manage to migrate a whole app to hooks, you can drop the Provider from `mobx-react` and use your own to gain even more control about it. Besides, it's inherently easier to correct types for own context (eg. with TypeScript).

### What about mapper function?

With original `inject` you were able to do something like following.

```tsx
@inject(stores => ({
  username: stores.user.name,
  orderId: stores.order.id,
}))
@observer
class UserOrderInfo extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.username} has order {this.props.orderId}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

It's important to realize here, that with hooks, such mapping utility is probably redundant. You can do that directly within the component as show in first example on this page.

Alternatively, you can make a custom hook that takes care of mapping only. It may prove useful for reusability purposes or simply a separation of concerns.

```tsx
function useUserData() {
  const { user, order } = useStores()
  return {
    username: user.name,
    orderId: order.id,
  }
}

const UserOrderInfo = observer(() => {
  // Do not destructure data!
  const data = useUserData()
  return (
    <div>
      {data.username} has order {data.orderId}
    </div>
  )
})
```

However, be warned here. If you would attempt to destructure `data`, you would lose the reactivity. That is the general problem of MobX and many got burned by it. An alternative and safer approach can look like following.

```tsx
import { useObserver } from 'mobx-react'
function useUserData() {
  const { user, order } = useStores()
  return useObserver(() => ({
    username: user.name,
    orderId: order.id,
  }))
}

const UserOrderInfo = () => {
  // this works now just fine
  const { username, orderId } = useUserData()
  return (
    <div>
      {username} has order {orderId}
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this case you can omit the wrapping `observer`, but you need to be sure there is no other observable present in the component.

## Make your own inject

If you are for some reason convinced that inject is superb pattern and you don't want to leave it, just make your own. The basic one looks as easy as this.

```tsx
import { MobXProviderContext } from 'mobx-react'
function inject(selector, baseComponent) {
  const component = ownProps => {
    const store = React.useContext(MobXProviderContext)
    return useObserver(() => baseComponent(selector({ store, ownProps })))
  }
  component.displayName = baseComponent.name
  return component
}
```

Note this implementation has `useObserver` inside which means that you won't need to wrap your component into `observer` also. These are the perks of being able to do it your way.

We highly recommend to use a different name than `inject`, especially if you gradually migrating and still using original `inject` alongside.
